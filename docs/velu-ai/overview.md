# Velu AI Overview

## What is Velu AI?
Velu AI is an autonomous documentation assistant designed to keep product knowledge accurate, consistent, and continuously updated. It connects to the tools SaaS teams already use—such as Slack, GitHub, Linear, Confluence, and Google Drive—to ingest release notes, tickets, specs, and conversations. Using this context graph, Velu AI detects stale content, drafts structured updates, and publishes them with governance safeguards, transforming documentation from a manual chore into an automated, trusted workflow.

## Who is Velu AI for?
Velu AI serves cross-functional product teams that depend on reliable documentation:

- **Technical writers** who need consolidated context and automated drafts to enforce style and accuracy at scale.
- **Product managers** who want documentation to reflect roadmap changes without coordinating multiple handoffs.
- **Developers** who rely on real-time API references and onboarding guides that stay in sync with code changes.
- **Support and customer success teams** who require up-to-date FAQs and troubleshooting content to resolve issues quickly.
- **Founders and lean SaaS teams** who must deliver professional documentation without hiring a dedicated writing staff.

By automating updates, applying approval controls, and integrating with existing publication channels, Velu AI ensures every feature change, customer insight, and support trend is captured as durable product knowledge.
